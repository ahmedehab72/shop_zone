MERN E-Commerce Platform
A full-stack e-commerce application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This project showcases a powerful backend with RESTful APIs, secure authentication, and advanced features like order processing and payment handling. The frontend (screenshots to be added) provides an intuitive interface for shopping, account management, and admin controls.
Features
Order and Payment Management

Create Orders: Users can place orders with items, shipping address, and payment method. Includes price calculation (items, tax, free shipping over $100).
Payment Processing: Update orders to "paid" with payment details (ID, status, payer email), designed for integration with gateways like PayPal or Stripe.
Order Status: Admins can mark orders as delivered with timestamps.
Order Tracking:
View personal order history (users).
View all orders with user details (admins).
Fetch specific order details by ID.


Analytics:
Total order count.
Total sales across all orders.
Daily sales reports for paid orders using MongoDB aggregation.


Security: Authentication required for order creation and updates; admin-only actions for delivery status.

Category Management

Create, update, and delete product categories (admin-only).
List all categories or fetch a specific category by ID.
Prevents duplicate category names.

Product Management

Add, update, and delete products with details like name, description, price, category, quantity, brand, and image (admin-only).
Fetch products with:
Keyword search and pagination (20 per page).
Top-rated (4) and newest (5) product lists.
Recent products (up to 12) with category details.


Add reviews (rating, comment) with duplicate prevention (authenticated users).
Filter products by category and price range.

User Management

Register and login with secure password hashing (bcrypt) and JWT tokens.
Update user profiles (username, email, password).
Admin features: view all users, delete non-admin users, update user details, and toggle admin status.
Logout by clearing JWT cookie.

Security and Middleware

Authentication: JWT tokens for secure access.
Authorization: Admin-only routes for sensitive actions.
Error Handling: Async handler middleware for robust error management.
File Uploads: Formidable for product images.
ID Validation: Ensures valid MongoDB IDs in routes.

Tech Stack

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (Mongoose)
Frontend: React (screenshots to be added)
Security: bcrypt, JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
Middleware: express-formidable, asyncHandler, authMiddleware, checkId
Tools: MongoDB aggregation, RESTful API design
